                Obtain RDD - As ReddID's require a small fee paid to the network, you'll need to obtain RDD.
                This can be done from the Instant Buy button on the "exchange" Tab (coming soon), or from any crypto exchange trading RDD.
                See the wiki for a full list.

            <p>
                Deposit RDD to your ReddID wallet - Public addresses for deposit are visible in the extension tab.
                You may wish to send a very small amount of RDD initially as a test before sending larger amounts.

                Select a ReddID name - Click on the "Register" tab and enter your desired ReddID name.
                If it is available on the blockchain, the extension will let you know the cost required for that particular ReddID.
                Ensuring you have adequate funds, click "Order".
